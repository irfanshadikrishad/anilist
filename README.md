#### AniList

Unofficial Anilist CLI

#### How to install?

Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) are already installed in your system.
Then install the package by running

```bash
npm install -g @irfanshadikrishad/anilist
```

This will install the package globally. And you have to use commands like

```bash
anilist tr -c 15
```

#### How to use?

Create an API client from [anilist developer setting](https://anilist.co/settings/developer) with an application name and redirect url as `https://anilist.co/api/v2/oauth/pin`. After creating the client you will get `Client ID` and `Client Secret` which is required in order to login from CLI.

To login:

```
anilist login -i <client-id> -s <client-secret>
```

here `<client-id>` and `<client-secret>` should be replaced by the ones that you recieved from the developer setting.
